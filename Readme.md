## What is this?
This project's purpose was to practice animating a lot of SVG items using JavaScript and JQuery. This was actually my first project where I noticed my machine struggling to render all elements on the screen. I was probably doing something wrong, but I could not figure out the root of the poor performance.
You can check it out here [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/oZmZLb) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### JS
- Adding SVG elements to the page
- Smoothly move items across the screen using X, Y coordinates
- Changing direction of movement when an item reaches the end of the screen
- Using random HEX code generator to generate colors for owls
- Creating awesome starry background

### CSS
- Applying CSS animations to animate certain parts of an SVG image
- Using multiple @keyframe animations to animate SVG owls
